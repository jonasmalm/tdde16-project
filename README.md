# From Fake News to Great Rules: Using Machine Learning to create human-interpretable rules to spot fake news

## Introduction
The code in this notebook was used in my project "From Fake News to Great Rules" in the LiU course TDDE16.

The dataset used is ["WELFake dataset for fake news detection in text data"](https://zenodo.org/record/4561253), published by Verma et al. in February 2021. The dataset is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Internaional.

## Abstract
Fake news is a big problem in society: it influences elections and creates vaccine hesitation, while most people struggle to identify fake news better than chance. This paper introduces a novel approach to help people make this distinction, by clustering the most influential words in a NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier based on similarity to create human-interpretable rules to identify fake news. Furthermore, through testing combinations of the clusters three simple rules are proposed which could significantly help humans differentiate fake news from real news with an estimated F1-score of >75%.
